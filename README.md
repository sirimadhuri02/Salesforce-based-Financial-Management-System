# Salesforce-based Financial Management System

## 1. Project Overview

[cite_start]This project outlines the development of a compact Financial Management System built on the Salesforce platform[cite: 5]. [cite_start]The system is designed to provide a single source of truth for managing budgets and tracking expenses, replacing disconnected spreadsheets and manual forms[cite: 4, 5]. [cite_start]The goal is to offer a solution that is quick to build (an estimated 3-4 hours for a minimum viable product) while being scalable for future enhancements like approvals and ERP integrations[cite: 6].

[cite_start]The core business problem this system addresses is the fragmentation of financial data, where budgets often live in Excel while expenses are tracked through notes or receipts, leading to panicked, error-prone reconciliation at the end of the month[cite: 15]. [cite_start]This fragmentation results in budget overspending, poor forecasting, wasted time on data cleaning, and compliance risks[cite: 19, 21, 23, 24].

## 2. Target Users & Personas

[cite_start]The system is designed for the following users[cite: 33]:

### [cite_start]Primary Users [cite: 34]
* [cite_start]**Budget Owner (Manager/Department Head):** Responsible for creating and managing budgets, requiring visibility and alerts[cite: 36].
    * [cite_start]**Persona: Anita, Department Head.** She wants a dashboard showing the remaining budget for her campaigns and an alert when any campaign's spending exceeds 80%[cite: 52, 53, 54, 55].
* [cite_start]**Expense Submitter (Employee/Clerk):** Needs a simple interface to record expenses and attach receipts against specific budgets[cite: 37].
    * [cite_start]**Persona: Leena, Field Employee.** As a frequent traveler, she needs a quick, mobile-friendly way to log expenses and upload receipts[cite: 59, 62, 63].
* [cite_start]**Finance Analyst/Accountant:** Reviews expenses and exports clean, structured data for reporting and reconciliation[cite: 38].
    * [cite_start]**Persona: Ravi, Junior Accountant.** He wants to eliminate the hours spent cleaning spreadsheets and needs a reliable system to export data with a clear audit trail[cite: 57, 58, 61].

### [cite_start]Secondary Stakeholders [cite: 39]
* [cite_start]**CFO/Finance Director:** Focuses on overall financial controls and compliance[cite: 40].
* [cite_start]**IT/Salesforce Admin:** Manages the application, user security, and integrations[cite: 41].
* [cite_start]**Auditors:** Require traceability and records of role-based access[cite: 42].

## [cite_start]3. Core Features & Functional Requirements (Phase 1) [cite: 89]

* [cite_start]**Objects & Data Model:** The system will use two primary custom objects: `Budget` (master) and `Expense` (child)[cite: 91].
* **Key Fields:**
    * [cite_start]On `Budget`: Planned Amount, a roll-up summary for Total Expenses, a formula field for Remaining Balance, and a Status picklist[cite: 92].
    * [cite_start]On `Expense`: Date, Amount, a master-detail relationship to Budget, a file upload for Receipts, and a Payment Mode picklist[cite: 92].
* **Automation:**
    * [cite_start]A roll-up summary to automatically calculate total expenses on the parent budget record[cite: 93].
    * [cite_start]A record-triggered Flow to update the budget status to "Within Budget" or "Exceeded"[cite: 93].
    * [cite_start]Validation rules to prevent negative expense amounts[cite: 93].
* **Reporting:**
    * [cite_start]A "Budget vs Actual" report[cite: 94].
    * [cite_start]An "Expense by Category" report[cite: 94].
    * [cite_start]A simple dashboard displaying key metrics[cite: 94].
* [cite_start]**Security:** Profiles and Permission Sets will be used to ensure only authorized users (like the Budget Owner or Finance team) can edit budget records[cite: 95].

## 4. Key Use Cases

1.  [cite_start]**Create a Budget:** A Budget Owner creates a new Budget record, defining the category, period, and planned amount[cite: 76, 77].
2.  [cite_start]**Record an Expense:** An Expense Submitter creates an Expense record, selects the parent Budget, and attaches a receipt[cite: 80, 81]. [cite_start]The system automatically updates the `Total Expenses` and `Remaining` balance on the budget[cite: 82].
3.  [cite_start]**Monitor Spending:** If an expense causes the budget to be exceeded, the budget's status automatically changes, and an alert can be sent[cite: 83]. [cite_start]The system can also send a weekly digest of budgets that are over 80% utilized[cite: 84, 85].
4.  [cite_start]**Reconcile at Month-End:** A Finance Analyst runs the "Budget vs Actual" report and exports the clean data to a CSV for accounting purposes[cite: 87, 88].

## 5. Success Metrics

[cite_start]The success of the project will be measured by[cite: 132]:
* [cite_start]**Adoption:** The number of budgets created and users actively recording expenses within the first 30 days[cite: 133].
* [cite_start]**Process Efficiency:** The amount of time (in hours) saved monthly on reconciliation tasks[cite: 134].
* [cite_start]**Financial Control:** The percentage of budgets that are flagged with alerts before they are exceeded[cite: 135].
* [cite_start]**Data Quality:** The percentage of expense records that have receipts attached[cite: 136].
* [cite_start]**Business Impact:** A measurable reduction in budget overspend incidents compared to the previous quarter[cite: 137].

## [cite_start]6. Risks & Mitigation Strategies [cite: 140]

* [cite_start]**Risk:** User resistance and a preference for spreadsheets[cite: 141].
    * [cite_start]**Mitigation:** Provide a minimal, mobile-friendly UI and demonstrate clear time-saving benefits to users[cite: 142].
* [cite_start]**Risk:** Poor data quality, such as missing receipts or incorrect allocations[cite: 143].
    * [cite_start]**Mitigation:** Implement validation rules and make the receipt field recommended for expenses over a certain threshold[cite: 145].
* [cite_start]**Risk:** Scope creep, especially requests for complex integrations early on[cite: 146, 149].
    * [cite_start]**Mitigation:** Strictly limit Phase 1 to the core features (Budgets, Expenses, roll-ups, and key reports)[cite: 148]. [cite_start]Defer integrations to a later phase and use CSV exports as an interim solution[cite: 151].
